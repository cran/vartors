Description: Generates R scripts useful to perform repetitive
    tasks on variables of different classes from a simple database. First it
    helps to create a tabular file describing the variables. Then the package
    could process this tabulate file to create a script in a .R or .Rmd format.
    This script will include code blocks for each variable according to the
    variable description. It could help to import, adapt to R classes and
    perform descriptive analysis on each variable according to its type. This R
    script could be used as it is or it could be modified if necessary to
    perform additional analysis. The user could write his own R script template
    to produce a customized script.
